1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/landing-page.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd landing-page`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the landing page.

## Dependencies
This project has no external dependencies. It uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Development Strategy
1. **Project Setup**: Link `app.js` at the end of `index.html` and create the basic HTML structure with at least four sections.
2. **Navigation Menu**: Dynamically build the navigation menu based on the sections present in the HTML.
3. **Section Active State**: Implement logic to highlight the section currently in view.
4. **Smooth Scrolling**: Enable smooth scrolling to sections when navigation items are clicked.
5. **Refactor and Test**: Ensure code quality, readability, and performance through refactoring and testing.

## Code Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the basic structure of the landing page.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains styles for the landing page, including responsiveness.
- `js/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for dynamic navigation, active state detection, and smooth scrolling.

## Comments
- Each function in `app.js` is preceded by a comment explaining its purpose.
- Crucial code sections within functions have additional comments for clarity.

## Code Quality
- The code follows consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting.
- ES6 features such as `const` and `let` are used.
- Functions are written using ES6 arrow functions where appropriate.
- The code is run through an ESLint for syntax checking and adherence to best practices.
